/**
 * Package com.Apples2Apples.player
 *
 * This package contains the core abstractions and implementations for players in the Apples to Apples game,
 * including human, bot, local, and online players. The design utilizes several key design patterns to manage
 * player behavior and ensure extensibility.
 *
 * Key Components:
 * - **AbstractPlayer**: A base class for all player types, providing common functionality.
 * - **BotPlayer**: A specific player type representing automated players.
 * - **HumanPlayer**: A specific player type representing human players.
 * - **OnlinePlayer**: A specific player type representing players in an online game environment.
 * - **Hand**: Represents a player's hand of cards, with methods to manage cards.
 * - **Judge**: Manages the selection and judging of cards, as well as the awarding of green apples.
 * - **Playable**: Interface representing objects that can be played (e.g., players, cards).
 * - **PlayerFactory**: Implements the Factory pattern to dynamically create player objects based on the type of player.
 * - **PlayerType**: An enumeration defining the different types of players (e.g., Bot, Human, Online).
 *
 * Design Patterns:
 * - **Factory Pattern**: Used in `PlayerFactory` to create players (e.g., BotPlayer, HumanPlayer, OnlinePlayer)
 *   dynamically based on game requirements.
 * - **Strategy Pattern (Partial)**: The card selection strategy can vary based on player types, allowing
 *   flexible behavior for different player kinds.
 * - **Observer Pattern**: Used to notify players about game events, ensuring that the game state is updated
 *   accordingly when changes occur.
 *
 * SOLID Principles:
 * - **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: Each class has a single responsibility, such as managing the
 *   player's hand, handling card selection, or acting as the game judge.
 * - **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**: The design allows for easy extension with new player types (e.g., adding
 *   a new player type like AI players) without modifying existing code.
 * - **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**: The `AbstractPlayer` class provides a common interface,
 *   ensuring that any subclass can replace the base class without affecting the program's correctness.
 * - **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**: The `Playable` interface is tailored to the specific needs of
 *   player objects, ensuring that players only implement what is relevant to them.
 * - **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**: High-level modules (e.g., Game) depend on abstractions like `Playable`
 *   or `PlayerFactory`, not on low-level modules like `HumanPlayer` or `BotPlayer`.
 *
 * Future Modifications:
 * The current design allows easy addition of new player types (e.g., OnlinePlayer, AIPlayer), game mechanics,
 * and customizations (e.g., different card selection strategies) with minimal changes to existing code.
