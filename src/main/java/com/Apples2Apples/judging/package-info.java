/**
 * The {@code com.Apples2Apples.judging} package defines core components
 * related to the judging mechanics in the Apples to Apples game. This package
 * enables flexible and extendable judging processes by providing interfaces
 * and classes for managing judges, selecting winning cards, and sending notifications.
 *
 * <h2>Responsibilities</h2>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Defining strategies for judging and selecting winning cards.</li>
 *   <li>Managing the judge rotation process during gameplay.</li>
 *   <li>Sending notifications to players regarding the game's progress.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Key Classes and Interfaces</h2>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link com.Apples2Apples.judging.JudgingStrategy}:
 *       An interface that defines the contract for selecting a favorite card.
 *   </li>
 *   <li>{@link com.Apples2Apples.judging.DefaultJudgingStrategy}:
 *       Implements the {@code JudgingStrategy} by delegating the selection process to the judge's logic.
 *   </li>
 *   <li>{@link com.Apples2Apples.judging.JudgeManager}:
 *       Manages the judging process, including selecting winners and rotating the judge role.
 *   </li>
 *   <li>{@link com.Apples2Apples.judging.NotificationService}:
 *       Provides functionality to send notifications during the game by utilizing the {@code GameNotification} class.
 *   </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Design Patterns</h2>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Strategy Pattern:</b> The {@code JudgingStrategy} interface and its
 *       implementations allow for flexible judging algorithms.
 *   </li>
 *   <li><b>Dependency Injection:</b> The {@code JudgeManager} and {@code NotificationService}
 *       classes use constructor injection to achieve loose coupling and testability.
 *   </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Usage</h2>
 * <p>Example of how to use the judging components:</p>
 * <pre>{@code
 * // Initialize the judging components
 * JudgingStrategy judgingStrategy = new DefaultJudgingStrategy();
 * GameNotification gameNotification = new GameNotification();
 * NotificationService notificationService = new NotificationService(gameNotification);
 * JudgeManager judgeManager = new JudgeManager(judgingStrategy, notificationService);
 *
 * // Simulate judging process
 * List<Card> redAppleSubmissions = ...; // Cards submitted by players
 * Judge currentJudge = ...; // Current judge
 * List<Player> players = ...; // All players
 *
 * // Select the winner
 * judgeManager.selectWinner(redAppleSubmissions, currentJudge, players);
 *
 * // Rotate the judge
 * Player nextJudge = judgeManager.rotateJudge(players, currentJudge);
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <h2>Future Extensions</h2>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Adding advanced judging strategies, such as AI-based selection algorithms.</li>
 *   <li>Integrating a scoring system for submitted cards.</li>
 *   <li>Enhancing notifications with more detailed feedback and animations.</li>
 * </ul>
